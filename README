                 Set the volume, or turn off, some speakers remotely.

Hardware
---------
An opto-isolator and a digital potentiometer can be used to modify
the manual controls for a set of speakers.

In my implementation the speakers being controlled are Creative
Inspire T6100 and the maple is connected via XBee to the pc over a
mesh network, so that more devices can be added.

Software
---------

 - Maple

    Some firmware has been written for maple to communicate with a
    computer over the serial port to control when to turn on or off
    the speakers and when to change the volume.

    The firmware will automatically turn off the speakers if it
    recieves no messages from the computer for a minute (watchdog).

 - Arduino
    Some firmware will also be written for an arduino implementation.
    (maybe)

 - PC
    A command line program has been written to send commands to the
    firmware.

    A Pulse Audio module will be written to map the volume controls
    from pulse audio to either the driver or the hardware (raise
    volume in software then in hardware).

	A gui program will be written to mimic the command line program.
	(maybe)
